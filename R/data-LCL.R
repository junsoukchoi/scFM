#' LCL Single-cell RNA-sequencing Dataset
#'
#' A pre-processed dataset consisting of 5,135 high-quality cells and the top 100 most variable genes, selected from the original set of 7,247 cells derived from the lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) GM12878, initially profiled for 18,170 genes. This dataset was used for the real data analysis of scFM in Choi et al. (2025+).
