The R package `scFM` implements an efficient data-augmented Gibbs sampler for the scFM model, a novel Bayesian segmented Gaussian copula factor model. This model is designed for analyzing single-cell sequencing data, specifically addressing challenges like excessive low counts and high skewness, while automatically determining the number of latent factors.

## Installation

To install the latest version of the R package `scFM` from Github, use 

```{r install, tidy = 'formatR', eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("junsoukchoi/scFM")
```
